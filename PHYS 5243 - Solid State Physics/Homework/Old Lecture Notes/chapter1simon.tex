		\subsection{1.1 - What is Condensed Matter Physics?}
			\begin{description}
				\item[Number of consituents is large]
				\item[interactions among constituents is strong]
			\end{description}
		\subsection{1.2 - Why study Condensed Matter Physics?}
			\begin{description}
				\item[Good Questions] \

					Why are metals shiny and cold? \\
					Why is glass transparent? \\
					Why is water fluid, why is it wet? \\
					Why is rubber soft?\\
				\item[Engineering] 
	
				\item[Awesomeness] \

					Higgs-Anderson mechanism $\rightarrow$ ties to Higgs Boson and superconductivity (Anderson coined Condensed Matter) \\
					Renormalization group \\
					Topological QFT $\rightarrow$ in lab of CMP \\
					black hole string theory $\rightarrow$ CMP
				\item[reductionism doesn't work] \

					Just accept it ..... :(
				\item[QM and Stat Mech are basis for CMP] 
			\end{description}
			
		\subsection{1.3 - Why Solid State?}
			Subfield of CMP $\rightarrow$ very large
