\section{Chapter 15 - Electrons in a Periodic Potential} 
	In Chapter 11 the tight binding method was applied to a 1 dimensional chain of atoms.  The tight binding method assumes the electrons are very strongly bound to the atoms and weakly hop between sites.  
	
	Here we will do the opposite in the Nearly Free Electron model.  The electrons are mostly free standing waves, but are weakly perturbed by a periodic lattice.
	\subsection{Nearly Free Electron Model}
		Completely free electrons with Hamiltonian:
			\begin{equation}
				H_0 = \frac{\vect{p}^2}{2m}
			\end{equation}
			The eigen energies for plane waves $|\vect{k}\rangle$ are:
			\begin{equation}
				\epsilon_0(\vect{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2|\vect{k}|^2}{2m}
			\end{equation}
			Now a weak periodic potential perturbation is applied to the Hamiltonian:
			\begin{equation}
				H = H_0+ V(\vect{r})
			\end{equation}
			We know $V$ is periodic, therefore:
			\begin{equation}
				V(\vect{r}) = V(\vect{r}+\vect{R})
			\end{equation}
